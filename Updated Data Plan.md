# Our Data Sets
1. [COVID Behind Bars](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk/edit#gid=1197647409)
2. [California Environmental Conditions](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/calenviroscreen-3-0-results)

# Our Plan 
The COVID Behind Bars data provides the latitude and longitude of prisons, jails, and detention centers in the US. We will be using the csv file to plot markers 
for the prisons and jails in California. Because the CSV file contains data from all 50 states, we will need to first filter the data so that only California data is used. The CSV has the current occupancy of each prison as of February 2020. 
The Cal Environmental data contains information by city and county on different environmental risk factors up to 2019. We will be 
applying the shapefile of this data to our map to provide dynamic visuals of the different environmental risks. We will be plotting the data of environmental risks such as Air Quality and Groundwater Threats.
