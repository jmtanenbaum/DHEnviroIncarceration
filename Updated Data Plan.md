# Our Data Sets
1. [COVID Behind Bars](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk/edit#gid=1197647409)
2. [California Environmental Conditions](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/calenviroscreen-3-0-results)

# Our Plan 
The COVID Behind Bars data provides the latitude and longitude of prisons, jails, and detention centers in the US. We will be using the csv file to plot markers 
for the prisons and jails in California. The Cal Environmental data contains information by city and county on different environmental risk factors. We will be 
applying the shapefile of this data to our map to provide dynamic visuals of the different environmental risks.
