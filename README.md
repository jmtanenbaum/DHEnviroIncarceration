# DHEnviroIncarceration

# Introduction
Our team's name is Environmental Racism in Carceral California. We will be focusing on investigating the relationship between mass incarceration in California and environmental racism using 2018 data from CalEnviroScreen, the Vera Institute’s County- and jurisdiction-level jail and prison data, and Reuter’s data on deaths in jails and prisons.

# Overview
Our group’s project will be investigating the relationship between mass incarceration and environmental racism in California in the late 2010s. The scope includes California prisons and jails between 2012, after the Brown v. Plata decision forced the state to reduce the prison population, and 2020. As preexisting research by scholars like Craig Gilmore and journalists like Candice Bernd, Zoe Loftus-Farren, and Maureen Nandini Mitra illustrates, mass incarceration fuels environmental injustice and the costs are deadly for incarcerated people and surrounding communities. California is an ongoing site of struggle against the expansion of prisons and jails and environmental racism. Organizations like the California Prison Moratorium Project and Fight Toxic Prisons challenge these intersecting forms of violence, and web mapping can illustrate the importance of their demands for prison abolition. 

# Methodology
Abolitionist geographer Ruth Wilson Gilmore reminds us that prisons are forgotten places, and the same goes for the communities that surround them. The abolitionist movement has recently focused on the environmental impact of mass incarceration, particularly in Central California, and struggled against both prisons and pollution. Web mapping is an ideal medium to illustrate these interlocking systems of violence and further the movement’s struggle.
