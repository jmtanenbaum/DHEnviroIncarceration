  <b>Julia:</b> I love the layers and interactive elements. 
  <b>Hannah:</b> I really like how visually clear the different data looks. I prefer one map with all the data over 2 different maps though.

  <b>Julia:</b> I love the idea of the polygons and pins. The colors could be useful as well. 
<b>Lisa:</b> Also love the polygons! I also like the idea of a dropdown menu to help make the map visual itself less chaotic.

<b>Hannah:</b> I really like how informative this design looks. I think we'll be constrained by whatever is contained in our csv files though, unless we want to write out a lot of stuff ourselves.  
<b>Lisa:</b> I like how the information frames the map on both sides, that might help the viewer visually distinguish them.

<div>
  <b>Julia:</b> I love the interactive markers and sidebar. This is really complete and thought out. 
 
 <b>Hannah:</b> I agree with Julia. You really put a lot into your design. I think my favorite elements are the multiple layers of information. Really awesome interactive elements too. I like the zoom function when you click on one of the "featured pins," and highlighting them with distinctive markers.

<div>
  <b>Julia:</b> I like the idea of different icons for prisons and jails and the layers for different enviornmental data.  
 <b>Lisa:</b> Also really liked having different icons differentiating jails from prisons & the toggling between layers of types of environmental data. Also like the idea hovering over a polygon to view environmental layers rather than clicking on them--I feel like clicking would become cumbersome.

<b>Hannah:</b> I think the searchbar and different marker icons are my favorite includes here. Multiple data layers will also be really important for what we want to do.  
<b>Lisa:</b> Seconding Hannah, I also like your note on including images. I'm not sure what type of images we'd want to use (images of the prison? of the specific subjects of the story?), but images are powerful in narratives
