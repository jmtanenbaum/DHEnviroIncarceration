In 2001, Latino youth in California’s infamously contaminated San Joaquin Valley identified “police, pollution, and prisons” as the most pressing environmental threats to their communities. Years later, scholarly research and investigative journalism confirm that mass incarceration continues to fuel environmental injustice across the state of California by concentrating pollution and toxic waste in marginalized communities. While the state and federal Environmental Protection Agency theoretically protect citizens from living near environmental hazards and monitor prisons and jails for violations of environmental law, organizations like the Prison Ecology Project argue that they fail to adequately protect incarcerated people and surrounding communities from these deadly threats. California’s vibrant abolitionist movement continues to demand mass releases and facility closures to save lives during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond, and we hope this map illustrates the urgency of this ongoing struggle.

Select a black dot to learn more about that prison, jail, or detention center. Click the layers icon on the top right corner to view the hazardous waste, groundwater threats, and pollution layers, which are yellow, blue, and red respectively. The darker the color is, the more polluted the area is. Use the search bar on the top left to search for a facility, and click the names of the featured facilities on the search bar to learn more about the groundwater pollution threats emanating from these sites.
